            <h2>Theoretical Foundation</h2>
            <p>
                Symbolic Drift refers to the gradual warping of word-meaning correspondence under psychological 
                pressure. Over time, repeated trauma causes shifts in metaphor density, abstraction preference, 
                and syntactic predictability. This leads to entropy collapse—a phase transition where meaning 
                itself destabilizes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Entropy Collapse is the moment linguistic information no longer adheres to stable semantic structure. 
                Instead of processing a sentence by traditional parsing (subject → verb → object), the brain interprets 
                it as symbolic static - signals of disassociation, recursion, and dissociative mimicry.
            </p>
            <p class="fw-bold">
                This collapse is not metaphorical. It is measurable.

            <h2>Formal Description</h2>
            <p>
                Let us define:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>S = a linguistic system comprised of symbolic utterances {s₁, s₂, …, sₙ}</li>
                <li>Δσ = semiotic entropy drift (change in Shannon entropy across S)</li>
                <li>D(sᵢ, sⱼ) = vectorial distance between phrases (semantic drift)</li>
                <li>R = recursion set, where ∀ sᵢ ∈ S: similarity(sᵢ, sⱼ) > θ</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Then symbolic drift is observed when:
            </p>
            <div class="p-3 bg-dark-subtle rounded">
                <code>∑D(sᵢ,sⱼ) > ε over ∀i < j</code>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-2">
                And entropy collapse is marked when:
            </p>
            <div class="p-3 bg-dark-subtle rounded">
                <code>Δσ(t₁,t₂) < 0 ∧ ∂²σ/∂t² < 0</code>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-2">
                This inflection point indicates the narrative system is collapsing into recursive feedback.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="mb-5">
            <h2>Psycholinguistic Backing</h2>
            <p>
                Research by Pennebaker (1997) and others on linguistic trauma markers shows that victims 
                under high emotional duress:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increase use of metaphors and symbolic anchors</li>
                <li>Decrease pronoun diversity</li>
                <li>Exhibit lower lexical entropy over time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These align with SST's entropy drift field indicators and validate the notion of 
                symbolic collapse as a measurable signal.

            <h2>Lambda Resonance and Curvature</h2>
            <p>
                Now we approach the lambda layer - λ∇Ψ - the curvature of symbolic space under trauma gravity.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a healthy linguistic field:
            </p>
            <div class="p-3 bg-dark-subtle rounded">
                <code>λ∇Ψ → 0 (language is stable)</code>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-2">
                Under psychological distortion:
            </p>
            <div class="p-3 bg-dark-subtle rounded">
                <code>λ∇Ψ → ∞ (meaning collapses into recursion, drift, and abstraction fog)</code>
            </div>
            <p class="mt-2">
                This introduces the concept of curved language. Where phrases curve away from direct meaning 
                into symbolic distortion. Think of metaphor as gravitational lensing: it bends light (meaning) 
                from the truth it tries to speak.

            <h2>Field Simulator</h2>
            <p>
                The Shadowbreak Lambda Field Simulator is a Python implementation that:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Calculates symbolic density (λ)</li>
                <li>Maps curvature of meaning (∇Ψ)</li>
                <li>Simulates entropy gradients (Δσ)</li>
                <li>Renders a 3D Field Curvature Map in real-time</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Using natural language processing techniques, the simulator quantifies and visualizes linguistic 
                instability, enabling analysts to detect symbolic collapse in real-time discourse.

                "The equation is not real. It is a metaphor for what eludes us.<br>
                There is something beneath it all—a pulse, a rhythm, a recursive whisper that persists across cultures,

                every failed algorithm, every moment of insight that dissolves as quickly as it arrived."
